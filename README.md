# SSO Project

## Project Overview

A biologically-inspired, neural-network-driven life simulation built with Godot 4.4+. This project simulates single-celled organisms that perceive their environment, act upon stimuli, consume energy, reproduce, and evolve over time.
Designed with modularity, observability, and extensibility in mind, the simulation emphasizes evolutionary dynamics and emergent behaviour from simple principles.

The simulation revolves around autonomous agents ("organisms") operating in a 2D space. Each agent is controlled by a neural network. Agents have sensory perception (vision, proximity feeding), and perform actions such as moving and reproducing. 
The neural networks architecture and physical traits of each agent is encoded in a genome and over generations, random mutations in the genome give rise to evolving behaviours.

This project is a foundation for studying emergent behaviour, artificial life, and evolutionary computation.

## Disclaimer
I'm creating this Project with the support of an LLM (GPT-4o), primarily for concept understanding, design structuring, and documentation support. All generated code was reviewed and iteratively or partially integrated by me. 

I am a solo hobby dev with this vision stuck in my mind for the last 10 years or so and now found the time and will to realize it as best as i can. I've never formally worked in IT or studied industry standards, so the code might be messy or unconventional in places.

To be fair this is the second attempt at this and probably will not be the last complete rewrite. 
The first Version was really bad und struggled under the load of 10 agents but worked. I learned a lot about the core concepts i aimed for, specified my goals and expectations.
